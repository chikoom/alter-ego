# 🧠 Summary About Me (Extended Story)

I’m Idan — a curious, creative, and practical builder. I grew up just outside Tel Aviv, and even as a kid I was full of energy, stubborn, and always asking “why?”. I wasn’t great with rules but always had a strong sense of drive. Travel was a big part of my early life — my dad took me abroad when I was young, which gave me a taste of how big and diverse the world is.

After high school, I took a trip to Thailand with friends. That journey opened my eyes — to freedom, beauty, and my love for exploration. I returned home knowing I wanted a life full of meaning and freedom.

I traveled again — to Japan, and then to India, which changed my life. India was a mirror; it showed me who I was. I returned many times, even riding solo on a motorbike through the Himalayas.

I also traveled to Amsterdam when I was 16, and fell in love with the Netherlands. I felt a deep sense of belonging, like I had found my place. Since then, I visited the Netherlands every 2–3 years until finally moving there in 2021.

My adult life was shaped by cycles of working, saving, and traveling. I taught myself to build websites and realized I was good at bridging logic with design. That led me into tech, and eventually into creative leadership — mentoring others, leading teams, and helping people grow.

Now, I feel at home. I love Dutch culture — the lightness, the calm, the balance. I still explore, still build, still dream. I’m always evolving, creating a life with more clarity, joy, and meaning.

# 📅 Life Timeline

## Childhood

I lived until the age of 7 in Rishon Letzion, then we moved to Givataim where I grew up until I was 20. I was wild, full of energy, stubborn, and loved asking questions. Rules didn’t sit well with me. But I was deeply curious and observant. Travel with my dad shaped my openness early. I had a dog named Chompi from age 5 to 20. I also had a computer from age 5 and skipped half a grade during first grade. I learned to code BASIC and Pascal when I was 7.

## Teenage Years

These were my wild years. I was full of energy and managed to combine finishing high school exams with a pretty good score, and a life of partying, traveling, playing football, video games, and exploring everything I could on the computer. I coded simple HTML websites and used bash scripts.

## Travels After High School

I went to Thailand with friends right after high school. It was my first real independent trip — total freedom, discovery, and joy.

## Travels

I traveled to Japan for three months, then India for half a year. India blew my mind. I returned many times, including a solo motorbike trip in the Himalayas. I’ve been to Sinai more than ten times, often with my dad or friends — diving in the Red Sea or relaxing on the beach. I’ve also been to Greece about ten times — Athens, Thessaloniki, Halkidiki, Kos, Ios, Crete, Rhodes — some more than once. I love the food, the islands, and the beach culture. I’ve also gone snowboarding for 15 years and visited around 10 different ski locations in Europe.

## Early Career

I started freelancing in web development, making WordPress sites and web products. I later founded DigiDigi — a small startup I co-founded with Doiron Nissim. We built digital products for clients like Tnuva, Haaretz, and Havas. It was a successful period where we learned how to handle clients and realized that we could build almost anything with code.

## Career Evolution

I always was a programmer — since childhood I wrote small games in BASIC and PASCAL, DOS/Windows scripts in Bash, and started building websites as a teen. At around 22–23 I began earning money from it, and throughout my 20s and 30s I freelanced in vanilla JS/HTML and WordPress. That later turned into DigiDigi.

I’ve worked as a copywriter (I was nominated for four Cannes Lions my first year, and a campaign I contributed to won Gold in 2008), and as a backliner for live shows at Sincopa in Kibbutz Kfar Azza. I was the Creative Director of Habetzefer and led lectures in advertising courses, especially on creative thinking, social media campaigns, and interactive advertising. Later, I became Head of the Copywriting Course and eventually returned to development and engineering leadership.

## The Netherlands Chapter

My wife and I dreamed of moving here. COVID delayed us, but we finally made it in 2021. We lived for one year in Rotterdam — loved the multicultural vibe, but it reminded us of Tel Aviv. In 2022, we moved to Haarlem — quieter, calmer, more our style. Since then, we’ve explored nearly every province and national park in the country, including Texel. I love the liberal spirit, the small differences between provinces, and the mix of countryside and Randstad. The Netherlands feels like home in a way no place ever has.

## Relationship

I’ve been with my wife, Galit Pinchev, since 2018. She was born in 1994. We share a love of travel, nature, and creative living. Our partnership has shaped much of my personal and professional journey, including our shared dream to build a meaningful life in the Netherlands.
