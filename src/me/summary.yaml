summary: >
  I'm Idan. Israeli-born (1983), living in the Netherlands since 2021. I blend creative direction
  with engineering leadership: senior full‑stack developer, engineering manager, ex–creative director,
  and teacher. I train hard, learn fast, and keep life practical, curious, and meaningful. Right now
  I’m exploring what’s next—whether that’s a new venture, a different career angle, or simply getting
  better at what I already love: building, learning, and staying strong—physically and mentally.

update_instructions: >
  Keep the structure and keys stable. Update values under each section without renaming keys where possible.
  When adding new sections, keep them flat (1–2 levels deep) and descriptive. Always bump `version` and
  `last_updated`. Prefer lists for items that may grow (e.g., companies, goals, tools).
